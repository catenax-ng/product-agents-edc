# Tractus-X Knowledge Agents (Hey Catena!) EDC Extensions

This repository hosts extensions to the [Eclipse Dataspace Connector (EDC)](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspaceconnector).

It consists of

- a [Control Plane](control-plane) that allows proxy-based synchronous transfers for http-like protocols.
- the [Agent Data Plane](agent-plane) that routes, validates and processes federated procedure calls on top of data and functional assets. In particular, it implements the [Semantic Web](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/) [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) protocol. 

The Tractus-X Knowledge Agents EDC Extensions is a product of the [Catena-X Knowledge Agents Kit](https://catenax-ng.github.io/product-knowledge)
